			<h1 class="title">Composition-Rosa Ramalho</h1>
			<p class="text">In this project, the objective was to create a composition that portrayed artisan Rosa Ramalho from a predefined theme. That theme was Active.
Something active is something with movement, vibrant colors, irregularities, there is manpower, dynamism.
We were provided with a photograph of a work by the artisan, in this case the one chosen was "Mulher no Caldeirão" and from there the composition was developed. </p>
